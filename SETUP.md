# Set up a development environment

Since we use `poetry` as the default package manager, it must be installed. Please refer to
`https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation`.

Run `poetry install` to get the dependencies.

Run `pre-commit install` to set the git checks before committing.

Make yourself sure you are able to run the tests. Refer to the appropriate section in this guide.
